# Organizational Guidelines

# Repo Structure

- `./works/` is where the articles are placed. Each "category" gets a folder with articles directly
  underneath.
- `./indexes/` is a set of auto-generated indexes. These are generated based on the category folders
  in the `./works/` directory.

Putting DRAFT in an article title excludes it from indexing.

# Primary Guidelines

All articles are written in markdown and formatted with `mdformat --wrap 100`.
